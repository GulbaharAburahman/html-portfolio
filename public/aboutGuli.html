<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Gulbahar Abdurahman, a dedicated and results-oriented software professional with a passion for ensuring the quality  <br />
  and functionality of digital solutions. With nearly 3 years of experience in both manual and automation testing, particularly <br />
  within Agile Scrum environments, I bring a wealth of expertise to every project I undertake.</p>

  <p>Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in requirement analysis, manual testing techniques, test automation, and defect tracking management.<br />
     I thrive in collaborative settings and have a proven track record of leading testing efforts for e-commerce projects, ensuring timely delivery of<br />
      high-quality software increments.</p>
  
  <p>My technical proficiency includes a strong command of programming languages such as Java, automation tools like Selenium WebDriver, and various<br />
     testing frameworks and methodologies. I am adept at designing and implementing automation frameworks, conducting cross-browser and API testing, <br />
     and managing code repositories using Git.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess a keen eye for detail, strong analytical abilities, and excellent communication skills. <br />
    I am highly adaptable, thrive in fast-paced environments, and am committed to continuous learning and improvement.</p>

  <p> Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in online courses, and staying active in the software testing community. <br />
  I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to innovative projects and make a meaningful impact in the world of software development.
